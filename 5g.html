          <p class="text">Apple strategically embraced the 5G wave, beginning with the iPhone 12 in 2020, despite initial critiques for perceived lateness. The company, after investing in Intel's modem development tech and settling with Qualcomm, swiftly launched the iPhone 12, becoming the world's top-selling 5G smartphone in 2021. This move positioned Apple as a leader in the 5G realm, with carriers rallying behind, making the device account for 24% of global 5G phone sales.

            Critics may have doubted Apple's timing, but its deliberate approach allowed it to capitalize on the expanding 5G landscape. The iPhone 13 continued this momentum, attracting a massive user base who were still in line for upgrades. Apple's strategic move isn't just about smartphones; it's about establishing a foothold in a future where 5G enables new hardware categories, including cars, glasses, and wearables.
            
            Apple's early commitment to 5G aligns with the broader industry trend, as nations invest in 5G infrastructure, offering improved data speeds and paving the way for high-bandwidth services. While the full potential of 5G is yet to be realized globally, Apple's proactive approach positions it to lead in the evolving landscape, with the promise of new opportunities and markets emerging, especially in developing regions like Africa, where improved connectivity can unlock economic potential. This is a large reason as to why Apples market cap is approaching 3 trillion, almost doubling since they implemented 5G services. </p>
