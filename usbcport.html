          <p class="text">Apple has announced plans to release an iPhone featuring USB-C charging, departing from its proprietary Lightning standard. The decision aligns with the European Union's newly finalized law mandating the use of USB-C for portable, battery-powered devices by fall 2024, including Apple's products. While the timeframe for the introduction of USB-C iPhones remains uncertain, it was assumed that Apple might unveil them in September 2024, preceding the EU law's implementation.

            However, Apple said they would implement USB as soon as late 2023. The confirmation raises questions about the fate of Lightning iPhones outside the EU post-law enforcement. Existing Lightning cables will persist for older iPhone models, as only those released after the EU regulation will incorporate USB-C ports. Accessories tied to the Lightning standard, such as cables, will remain relevant until Apple discontinues Lightning iPhones, with the company's continued sale of these cables post-Lightning iPhone cessation remaining unclear.
            
            Transitioning to USB-C across all Apple devices could simplify charging, requiring a single USB-C cable and charging brick for various products. This move would eliminate the need for separate cables for Mac laptops, iPads, iPhones, AirPods, and certain iPads. Users may not need to purchase new charging bricks if they already possess those with USB-C ports, and Apple is likely to include USB-C-to-USB-C cables with the new iPhones. However, the potential inclusion of charging bricks with the devices remains uncertain.
            
            Despite USB-C's occasional confusion between cables designed solely for charging or data transfer, Apple's shift could enhance charging convenience and compatibility across its product ecosystem. The likelihood of Apple resuming the inclusion of charging bricks with USB-C iPhones remains uncertain.</p>
