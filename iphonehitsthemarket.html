          <p class="text">The inaugural iPhone, launched on June 29, 2007, marked the start of Apple's transformative journey in tech. Despite its modest size at 4.5 inches by 2.4 inches, in contrast to today's larger models like the iPhone XS Max, it laid the foundation for the iconic brand. Debuting without third-party apps and capped at 16GB of flash memory, the iPhone was tied exclusively to AT&T's EDGE GSM network, known for its sluggishness.

            In a smartphone arena dominated by Nokia, RIM, Motorola, Palm, and Sony Ericsson, the iPhone's revolutionary touchscreen set it apart from predecessors with physical keyboards. Despite this innovation, skepticism was widespread at its announcement. Steve Ballmer of Microsoft claimed it would crash and burn, highlighting the impracticality of a $500 subsidized device. BlackBerry's leaders, Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, were perplexed at the unveiling. Outlets like TechCrunch boldly predicting failure.
            
            Unveiled at the 2007 Macworld event, Steve Jobs passionately dismantled existing smartphones' flaws, heralding the iPhone's buttonless design and expansive screen. The subsequent "Hello" commercial teased imminent disruption of the phone market.
            
            On June 29, 2007, the iPhone hit the market, priced at $499 and $599 for the 4GB and 8GB models, bundled with a two-year AT&T contract. Running on iPhone OS 1, it lacked third-party apps until the App Store's 2008 introduction with the iPhone 3G. Reviews were mixed, acknowledging revolutionary aspects but noting flaws.
            
            Apple's initial sales of 1.9 million iPhones in 2007 have since exploded to 216.76 million in 2017, solidifying its market dominance. The iPhone's evolution paved the way for subsequent Apple innovations, including the iPod Touch in 2007 and the iPad in 2010. </p>
